# Bachelor Thesis: Microservice on Amazon Web Services

This repository contains the source code and supporting materials for my bachelor thesis, titled "Microservice on Amazon Web Services". This thesis will document the implementation of a microservice on AWS in Python and ElasticSearch. It will first provide an overview of cloud computing and virtualization concepts, followed by an explanation of the AWS services utilized. The microservice functions on both front-end and back-end platforms. Specifically, the back-end portion is responsible for creating, managing, and updating product indices on ElasticSearch, while the front-end portion exposes several APIs to facilitate querying of these indices.

## Files
The main file for the thesis is **index.pdf**, which contains the full text of the thesis. The repository also includes the LaTeX source files for the thesis, as well as any supporting materials such as images and data files.

## Usage
To view the thesis, simply open the index.pdf file in a PDF viewer. The LaTeX source files can be used to compile the thesis on your own system, if desired.

## Requirements
To compile the LaTeX source files, you will need a LaTeX distribution installed on your system. I used MiKTeX to compile the thesis, but other distributions such as TeX Live should also work.
